Email Confirmation
Welcome aboard, {user.name}!

We have created an account for you in our internal identity system. This system is separated from the ones managed by the schools or the university. So, your zID and zPass will not work here. You need to confirm your E-mail adress and set a password for your new account. It will authorize you to access our internal web-based systems.

Please use the following link to confirm your email.

{site[root_url]}{site[base_url]}account/confirm-email?uid={user.id}&token={user.email_confirm_token}

If you find any problem, please contact the system administrators immediately.
